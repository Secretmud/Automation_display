# Automation panel

I made this to learn pyserial and flask.

## Requirements

flask
```bash
pip install flask
```
serial
```bash
pip install pyserial
```
Arduino

## The idea

The idea behind this project is to control a arduino using a web application.
This is something I find interesting. This might also be useful for someone else
this is why I uploaded the code I used to make this work. 

#### Important

If you like this project feel free to download and modify it as you seem fit
as long as you stick to the GPL.
